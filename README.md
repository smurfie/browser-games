# Browser Games

## Description
Browser games is a repo of two games made a long time ago (around 2013) with KinetikJS. I adapted the games to the new technologies (Express and node) and made a few (very few) adjustments. The idea is that at some point in the future this repo will grow (or not). By now the games are only two:

### Snaek: The snake
It's a game based on the popular snake game but with some more things (more items, enemies, bosses, a story...). The game has a story menu that it has 2 whole chapters, after this there is no more content. Only the story and the library options were implemented (hence the `Beta` label) but the story is long and difficult (even in the easy mode) enough to be playable for a little while.

### Maze
This is a basic labyrinth/maze game where you have to get to the exit the fastest you can. You can modify the height and width of the maze and the scattering (More scattering means shorter mazes but with more paths). You can also select random scattering and a value between 15 and 60 will be selected for you. The game saves your best time for the parameters selecteds.
